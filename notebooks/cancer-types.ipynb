       "  'Cancer begins when healthy cells change and grow out of control, forming a mass called a tumor. A tumor can be cancerous or benign. A cancerous tumor is malignant, meaning it can grow and spread to other parts of the body. A benign tumor means the tumor can grow but will not spread. In general, AdCC is a cancerous tumor that begins in glands found in the head and neck region. In rare cases, it can form in other parts of the body, including in the brain, breast, lung, or the uterus. Most often, AdCC starts in the salivary glands found in the lips, mouth, tongue, nose, throat, vocal cords, and part of the esophagus and windpipe. This part of the body is known as the \"upper aerodigestive tract.\" AdCC is sometimes classified as a disease of the minor salivary gland, even though it may begin at other locations. Besides being classified based on where the cancer begins, AdCC is also described based on what the tumor cells look like under a microscope. This is called the histologic variations of the tumor. The tumor can be classified as: cylindroma: a tumor with tube-shaped cells\\n\\n\\ncribriform: a tumor with gaps between the cells, giving it the appearance of Swiss cheese\\n\\n\\nsolid AdCC When AdCC spreads, it tends to spread along nerves, known as perineural invasion, or through the bloodstream. It spreads to the lymph nodes in about 5% to 10% of cases. If AdCC spreads to another part of the body beyond the lymph nodes, it is called metastatic cancer. The most common place for AdCC metastases is the lung. AdCC is known for having long periods of no growth, also called indolence, followed by growth spurts. But AdCC can behave aggressively in some people. This makes the course of AdCC unpredictable. This guide covers AdCC. Learn more about other types of\\xa0salivary gland cancers\\xa0and other\\xa0head and neck cancers\\xa0in separate guides on this website.

       "  'AdCC is an uncommon type of cancer. Each year, an estimated 1,300 people in the United States are diagnosed with AdCC. Worldwide, an estimated 200,000 people have this disease. About 60% are women. AdCC can occur in adults and children. ',\n",
       "  'There are different types of statistics that can help doctors evaluate a person‚Äôs chance of recovery from AdCC. These are called survival statistics. It is important to remember that statistics on the survival rates for people with AdCC are only an estimate. They cannot tell an individual person if cancer will or will not shorten their life. Instead, these statistics describe trends in groups of people previously diagnosed with the same disease, including specific stages of the disease. One study found that the 5-year survival rate for people in the United States with AdCC is approximately 80%. The 10-year survival rate is about 61%, and the 15-year survival rate is approximately 29%. The survival rates for AdCC vary based on several factors. These include the stage of cancer, a person‚Äôs age and general health, and how well the treatment plan works. Late recurrences are common among people diagnosed with AdCC. A late recurrence is cancer that has come back many years after treatment has finished. About half of the time, recurrences of AdCC are diagnosed at the metastatic stage, meaning it has spread to other parts of the body. However, tumor growth for AdCC is often slow, and people may live a long time with metastatic disease. Experts measure survival rate statistics for AdCC cancer every 5 years. This means the estimate may not reflect the results of advancements in how AdCC is diagnosed or treated from the last 5 years. Talk with your doctor if you have any questions about this information. Learn more about understanding statistics.

       "  'There are many tests used for diagnosing adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC). Not all tests described here will be used for every person. Your doctor may consider these factors when choosing a diagnostic test: The type of cancer suspected\\n\\n\\nYour signs and symptoms\\n\\n\\nYour age and general health\\n\\n\\nThe results of earlier medical tests In addition to a physical examination, the following tests may be used to diagnose AdCC: Biopsy. A biopsy is the removal of a small amount of tissue for examination under a microscope. Other tests can suggest that cancer is present, but only a biopsy can make a definite diagnosis. A pathologist then analyzes the sample(s). A pathologist is a doctor who specializes in interpreting laboratory tests and evaluating cells, tissues, and organs to diagnose disease. The pathology of the salivary gland may be complicated, even among experienced pathologists. This is why it is important that the tissue is examined by a head and neck pathologist who is experienced in diagnosing salivary gland diseases.The biopsy can be performed in different ways: using a fine needle biopsy or by surgically removing part or all of the tumor. A fine needle biopsy is also called fine needle aspiration or FNA. This procedure uses a thin needle to remove fluid and cells from the suspicious area. An AdCC tumor is characterized by a distinctive pattern in which bundles of epithelial cells surround and/or infiltrate ducts or glandular structures within the organ. Frequently, diagnosis of AdCC is made after the surgical removal of a tumor first thought to be benign. Imaging tests. Imaging techniques, primarily magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan, are useful to help doctors see the size and location of the tumor before surgery. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan may also be used to determine if the tumor has spread to other parts of the body. Each scan is described in more detail below. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses magnetic fields, not x-rays, to produce detailed images of the body. MRI can be used to measure the tumor‚Äôs size. A special dye called a contrast medium is given before the scan to create a clearer picture. This dye can be injected into a patient‚Äôs vein or given as a pill or liquid to swallow. An MRI is very useful for identifying perineural spread of AdCC. Perineural spread is growth of the tumor along nerve branches.\\nComputed tomography (CT or CAT scan). A CT scan takes pictures of the inside of the body using x-rays taken from different angles. A computer combines these pictures into a detailed, 3-dimensional image that shows any abnormalities or tumors. A CT scan can be used to measure the tumor‚Äôs size. Sometimes, a special dye called a contrast medium is given before the scan to provide better detail on the image. This dye can be injected into a patient‚Äôs vein or given as a pill or liquid to swallow.\\nPositron emission tomography (PET) or PET-CT scan. A PET scan is usually combined with a CT scan (see above), called a PET-CT scan. However, you may hear your doctor refer to this procedure just as a PET scan. A small amount of a radioactive sugar substance is injected into the patient‚Äôs body. This sugar substance is taken up by cells that use the most energy. However, the\\xa0amount of\\xa0radiation\\xa0in the substance is too low to be harmful. Because cancer tends to use energy actively, it absorbs more of the radioactive substance. A scanner then detects this substance to produce images of the inside of the body. After diagnostic tests are done, your doctor will review the results with you. If the diagnosis is cancer, these results also help the doctor describe the cancer. This is called staging. The next section in this guide is Stages. It explains the system doctors use to describe the extent of the disease. Use the menu to choose a different section to read in this guide. ',\n",
       "  'Staging is a way of describing where a cancerous tumor is located, if or where it has spread, and whether it is affecting other parts of the body. Doctors use diagnostic tests to find out the cancer‚Äôs stage, so staging may not be complete until all of the tests are finished. Knowing the stage helps the doctor recommend the best kind of treatment, and it can help predict a patient‚Äôs prognosis, which is the chance of recovery. There are different stage descriptions for different types of cancer. This page provides detailed information about the system used to find the stage of AdCC and the stage groups for AdCC, such as stage II or stage IV. TNM staging system\\n\\n\\nStage groups for AdCC ',\n",
       "  'AdCC is staged using the TNM system for salivary gland tumors.\\xa0 If the tumor originates from a major salivary gland, the staging system for a major salivary gland tumor is used. If the tumor originates from a minor salivary gland, the TNM staging system used for the location or primary site is used. For example, a AdCC that arises from a salivary gland in the palate will be staged according to the TNM staging system for the oral cavity.\\xa0 Doctors use the results from diagnostic tests and scans to answer these questions: Tumor (T): How large is the primary tumor? Where is it located?\\n\\n\\nNode (N): Has the tumor spread to the lymph nodes? If so, where and how many?\\n\\n\\nMetastasis (M): Has the cancer spread to other parts of the body? If so, where and how much? The results are combined to determine the stage of cancer for each person. There are 5 stages: stage 0 (zero) and stages I through IV (1 through 4). The stage provides a common way of describing the cancer so doctors can work together to plan the best treatments. Staging can be clinical or pathological. Clinical staging is based on the results of tests done before surgery, which may include physical examinations and imaging tests. Pathological staging is based on what is found during surgery, including biopsy. In general, pathological staging provides the most information to determine a patient‚Äôs prognosis. Here are more details on each part of the TNM system: ',\n",
       "  'Using the TNM system, the \"T\" plus a letter or number (0 to 4) is used to describe the size and location of the tumor. Tumor size is measured in centimeters (cm). A centimeter is roughly equal to the width of a standard pen or pencil. Stage may also be divided into smaller groups that help describe the tumor in even more detail. Specific tumor stage information is listed below. TX: The primary tumor cannot be evaluated. T0 (T zero): No evidence of a tumor is found. T1: The tumor is small, 2 centimeters (cm) at its widest dimension. It is also noninvasive, which means it has not grown outside the area where it began. T2: The tumor is larger, between 2 cm and 4 cm, but noninvasive. T3: The tumor is larger than 4 cm, but not larger than 6 cm, and has spread beyond the salivary gland. However, the tumor does not affect the seventh nerve, which is the facial nerve that controls such expressions as smiles or frowns. T4a: The tumor has invaded the skin, jawbone, ear canal, and/or facial nerve. T4b: The tumor has invaded the skull base and/or the nearby bones and/or encases the arteries. ',\n",
       "  'The ‚ÄúN‚Äù in the TNM staging system is for lymph nodes, the small, bean-shaped organs help fight infection. For AdCC, lymph nodes near the head and neck are called regional lymph nodes. Lymph nodes in other parts of the body are called distant lymph nodes. NX: The neck has undergone an intervention that prevents the evaluation of lymph nodes. N0: There is no evidence of cancer in the regional nodes. N1: The cancer has spread to a single node on the same side as the primary tumor, and the cancer found in the node is 3 cm or smaller. N2a: The cancer has spread to a single lymph node on the same side as the primary tumor and is larger than 3 cm, but not larger than 6 cm. N2b: The cancer has spread to more than one lymph node on the same side as the primary tumor, and no tumor measures larger than 6 cm. N2c: The cancer has spread to more than one lymph node on either side of the body, and no tumor measures larger than 6 cm. N3: The cancer found in the lymph nodes is larger than 6 cm. ',\n",
       "  'The \"M\" in the TNM system describes cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, called metastasis. MX: Distant metastasis cannot be evaluated. M0: The cancer has not spread to other parts of the body. M1: The cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Return to top ',\n",
       "  'Doctors assign the stage of the cancer by combining the T, N, and M (see above) classifications. Stage I: This stage describes a noninvasive tumor (T1 or T2) with no spread to lymph nodes (N0) and no distant metastasis (M0). Stage II: This stage describes an invasive tumor (T3) with no spread to lymph nodes (N0) or distant metastasis (M0). Stage III: This stage describes a smaller tumor (T1 or T2) that has spread to regional lymph nodes (N1) but shows no sign of metastasis (M0). Stage IVA: This stage describes any invasive tumor (T4a) that either has no lymph node involvement (N0) or has spread to only a single, same-sided lymph node (N1), but with no metastasis (M0). It is also used to describe a T3 tumor with one-sided nodal involvement (N1) but no metastasis (M0), or any tumor (any T) with extensive nodal involvement (N2) but no metastasis (M0). Stage IVB: This stage describes any cancer (any T) with more extensive spread to lymph nodes (N2 or N3) and no metastasis (M0). Stage IVC: This stage describes any cancer (any T, any N) with distant metastasis (M1). Recurrent: Recurrent cancer is cancer has come back after treatment. If the cancer does return, there will be another round of tests to learn about the extent of the recurrence.

       "  'In cancer care, different types of doctors often work together to create a patient‚Äôs overall treatment plan that combines different types of treatments. This is called\\xa0a multidisciplinary team.\\xa0Cancer care teams include a variety of health care professionals, including physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, oncology nurses, social workers, pharmacists, counselors, dietitians, and others. People with AdCC may work with physicians and other health care professionals in different specialties. These include: Medical oncologist: a doctor who specializes in treating cancer with medication\\n\\n\\nRadiation oncologist: a doctor who specializes in giving radiation therapy to treat cancer\\n\\n\\nSurgical oncologist: a doctor who specializes in treating cancer using surgery\\n\\n\\nMaxillofacial prosthodontist: a specialist who performs restorative surgery in the head and neck areas\\n\\n\\nOtolaryngologist: a doctor who specializes in the ear, nose, and throat\\n\\n\\nPlastic, or reconstructive, surgeon: a surgeon who specializes in the reconstruction of facial and body tissue and the improvement in a person\\'s appearance\\n\\n\\nOncologic dentist or oral oncologist: dentists experienced in caring for people with head and neck cancer\\n\\n\\nAudiologist: a health professional who specializes in hearing and balance problems\\n\\n\\nPhysical therapist: a health professional who addresses functional challenges that may develop as a result of cancer and cancer treatment\\n\\n\\nSpeech pathologist: a specialist who helps people use muscles in the mouth and throat\\n\\n\\nMental health providers: health professionals who diagnose and treat mental health problems, such as a psychiatrist or a psychologist It is extremely important that the cancer care team creates a comprehensive treatment plan before treatment begins, and people may need to be seen by several specialists before a treatment plan is fully developed. Although eliminating the cancer is the primary goal of treatment, preserving the function of the nearby nerves, organs, and tissues is also very important. When planning treatment, doctors consider how it might affect a person‚Äôs quality of life, such as how a person feels, looks, talks, eats, and breathes. Treatment options and recommendations depend on several factors, including the type and stage of cancer, possible side effects, and the patient\\'s preferences and overall health. Take time to learn about all of your treatment options and be sure to ask questions about things that are unclear. Talk with your doctor about the goals of each treatment and what you can expect while receiving the treatment. These types of talks are called \"shared decision-making.\" Shared decision-making is when you and your doctors work together to choose treatments that fit the goals of your care. Learn more about\\xa0making treatment decisions. Common types of treatments used for AdCC are described below, including surgery, radiation therapy, and systemic therapies using medication. Your care plan may also include treatment for your symptoms and side effects, an important part of cancer care.

       "  'Surgery is the removal of the tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue during an operation. Surgical removal of the tumor is the best treatment for AdCC as long as it can be done safely and is likely to have a good outcome. During surgery, the surgeon will remove the tumor and an area of healthy tissue surrounding it, called a margin. Surgery is considered the most successful if the margin removed during surgery is found to be ‚Äúclean,‚Äù which means there is a minimum of 2 millimeters (mm) of cancer-free tissue surrounding the tumor. The extent of surgery will vary depending on the location of the tumor and the area of the body involved. Because AdCC may frequently spread along nerves, the surgeon should examine and determine whether nerves are involved. Major nerves that are not involved should be identified and spared during surgery. Smaller branches of nerves should be analyzed to determine if the cancer has spread to the space surrounding the nerve. For a later-stage tumor or one that significantly involves nerves, the surgeon should remove as much of the tumor as possible while sparing the organs and functions of the face. These are difficult decisions to make. Talk with your doctor about how to find a surgeon with the necessary level of expertise, experience, and training to perform this type of surgery. Side effects from surgery vary depending upon the surgical site. For example, surgery of the parotid salivary gland may damage facial nerves, which can cause the muscles in the face to droop. Sometimes, a facial nerve graft or other reconstructive procedure (plastic surgery) may be recommended to restore the function of the facial muscles after surgery to remove the tumor. Learn more about the basics of surgical reconstruction. Before surgery, talk with your health care team about the possible side effects from the specific surgery you will have and whether reconstruction will be needed. Learn more about the basics of cancer surgery. Additional cancer treatment may be needed after surgery, called adjuvant therapy. Occasionally, it is not possible to remove AdCC using surgery. This type of tumor is called inoperable or unresectable. In these cases, your doctor will recommend other treatment options, such as radiation therapy or cancer medication (see below). Return to top ',\n",
       "  \"Radiation therapy is the use of high-energy x-rays or other particles to destroy cancer cells. The most common type of radiation therapy is called external-beam radiation therapy, which is radiation given from a machine outside the body. A radiation therapy regimen, or schedule, usually consists of a specific number of treatments given over a set period. Radiation therapy is particularly effective for AdCC as an adjuvant therapy by helping to eliminate any microscopic cancer cells that may remain in the body after surgery. Adjuvant therapy is cancer treatment given after surgery. In general, radiation therapy is not used before surgery for this disease. That is because many surgeons feel that the surgical wound heals better if radiation therapy is not given prior to surgery. A specific method of external-beam radiation therapy, known as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), allows for more effective doses of radiation therapy to be delivered while reducing the damage to healthy cells and causing fewer side effects. Since radiation therapy is targeted to a specific area, the side effects will depend on where the radiation therapy was given. Generally, during head and neck treatments, people may experience a sore mouth and/or throat that can cause pain and difficulty in swallowing. They may also have a skin reaction or burn that causes some pain over time. Before beginning radiation therapy for any head and neck cancer, people should receive a thorough examination from an oncologic dentist. Since radiation therapy can cause tooth decay, damaged teeth may need to be removed. Often, tooth decay can be prevented with proper treatment from a dentist before beginning treatment. Learn more about dental and oral health during cancer treatment. People should also receive an evaluation from a speech pathologist with experience treating people with head and neck cancer. The speech pathologist can teach exercises that will help maintain the strength and flexibility of the muscles used during speech and swallowing. If side effects are affecting a person's nutrition or weight, talk with a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) about coping with eating challenges. Long-term side effects of radiation therapy vary with the sites involved, but they may include permanent loss of saliva, causing dryness of the mouth and deterioration of the teeth. In some cases, a drug to stimulate the parotid salivary gland and increase or restore saliva levels may be given. Currently, amifostine (Ethyol), a drug to protect tissues during radiation therapy, is being studied. Scarring or fibrosis, which is the hardening or thickening of the skin and muscles, may develop several months to years after radiation therapy and lead to problems with wound healing, neck stiffness, and trouble swallowing. Other long-term effects that can develop include accelerated narrowing of the carotid arteries, which supply the head and neck with blood. There may also be lower thyroid gland functioning, called hypothyroidism, which can be managed with thyroid hormone replacement medication. Learn more about the basics of radiation therapy. Return to top \",\n",
       "  'Neutron therapy is a different form of radiation therapy that uses neutrons rather than x-rays. Compared with conventional radiation therapy, neutrons can deliver 20 times to 100 times more energy along their path length, causing much greater damage to the cancer cells. Neutron radiation therapy has been tested on many different types of tumors, and its treatment for salivary gland tumors and AdCC has shown the greatest benefit. In certain instances, neutron radiation therapy may be the first treatment for AdCC, particularly in areas of the body where it is difficult to perform surgery. However, neutron therapy carries more severe side effects than traditional radiation therapy, such as severe sore mouth and/or throat and difficulty swallowing; therefore, it is generally used more often with people with an inoperable tumor or if the tumor recurs. Medication to help increase saliva production and protect tissues may be given during this treatment. Neutrons cannot be used to treat large areas of the body if there is widespread metastatic disease. Neutrons can be used to treat a single metastasis that is causing problems, such as pain, blockage of part of the lung, or pressure on the spinal cord. Proton therapy, also called proton beam therapy, is a type of external-beam radiation therapy that uses protons rather than x-rays. At high energy, protons can destroy cancer cells. The advantage of proton therapy is the ability to better control where the radiation is delivered, greatly reducing the damage to normal healthy tissues that surround the tumor. However, proton therapy has not been extensively researched for use in AdCC. Learn more about the basics of proton therapy. Neutron and proton therapy are not widely available. Talk with your doctor for information about the availability of these treatments if recommended for you. Return to top ',\n",
       "  'Cancer and its treatment cause physical symptoms and side effects, as well as emotional, social, and financial effects. Managing all of these effects is called palliative care or supportive care. It is an important part of your care that is included along with treatments intended to slow, stop, or eliminate the cancer. Palliative care focuses on improving how you feel during treatment by managing symptoms and supporting patients and their families with other, non-medical needs. Any person, regardless of age or type and stage of cancer, may receive this type of care. And it often works best when it is started right after a cancer diagnosis. People who receive palliative care along with treatment for the cancer often have less severe symptoms, better quality of life, and report that they are more satisfied with treatment. Palliative treatments vary widely and often include medication, nutritional changes, relaxation techniques, emotional and spiritual support, and other therapies. You may also receive palliative treatments similar to those meant to get rid of the cancer, such as chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation therapy. Before treatment begins, talk with your doctor about the goals of each treatment in the treatment plan being recommended. You should also talk about the possible side effects of the specific treatment plan and palliative care options. Many patients also benefit from talking with a social worker and participating in support groups. Ask your doctor about these resources, too. During treatment, your health care team may ask you to answer questions about your symptoms and side effects and to describe each problem. Be sure to tell the health care team if you are experiencing a problem. This helps the health care team treat any symptoms and side effects as quickly as possible. It can also help prevent more serious problems in the future. Learn more about the importance of tracking side effects in another part of this guide.

       "  'If cancer spreads to another part in the body from where it started, doctors call it metastatic cancer. If this happens, it is a good idea to talk with doctors who have experience in treating it. Doctors can have different opinions about the best standard treatment plan. Close observation may be recommended, especially if the disease is slow growing and causing no symptoms. Clinical trials might also be an option. Learn more about getting a second opinion before starting treatment, so you are comfortable with your chosen treatment plan. Your treatment plan may include a combination of surgery and radiation therapy. Palliative care will also be important to help relieve symptoms and side effects. For most people, a diagnosis of metastatic cancer is very stressful and difficult to bear.

       "  'The treatment plan may include medications to destroy cancer cells. Medication may be given through the bloodstream to reach cancer cells throughout the body. When a drug is given this way, it is called systemic therapy.

A chemotherapy regimen, or schedule, usually consists of a specific number of cycles given over a set period. A patient may receive 1 drug at a time or combinations of different drugs given at the same time.\\xa0Learn more about the basics of chemotherapy and preparing for treatment. In general, chemotherapy is usually not used for AdCC, as this type of cancer appears to be less responsive to chemotherapy than other types of cancer. Various combinations of chemotherapy have been tried without much success. Researchers are looking at the combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, but this is considered experimental for AdCC. Targeted therapy for metastatic AdCC Targeted therapy is a treatment that targets\\xa0the cancer‚Äôs\\xa0specific\\xa0genes,\\xa0proteins, or the tissue environment that contributes to cancer growth and survival.\\xa0This type\\xa0of\\xa0treatment blocks the growth and spread of cancer cells\\xa0and limits\\xa0damage to\\xa0healthy\\xa0cells.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Not\\xa0all tumors have the same targets. To find the most effective treatment, your doctor may run tests to identify the genes, proteins, and other factors in your tumor.\\xa0This helps doctors\\xa0better match each patient with the most effective treatment whenever possible.\\xa0In addition,\\xa0research studies\\xa0continue\\xa0to find out more about specific molecular targets and\\xa0new treatments directed at them.\\xa0Learn more about\\xa0the basics of\\xa0targeted treatments. For AdCC, clinical trials are researching the use of targeted therapy drugs called tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as lenvatinib (Lenvima), or axitinib (Inlyta), taken as oral medication. This has shown to be a beneficial approach for a small proportion of people with AdCC. Because of the general rarity of AdCC and that current chemotherapy is of limited benefit, it is recommended that people with AdCC ask about clinical trials to treat this disease.\\xa0 It may also be beneficial to get a second opinion regarding AdCC treatment options.

       "  'A remission is when cancer cannot be detected in the body and there are no symptoms. This may also be called having ‚Äúno evidence of disease‚Äù or NED. A remission may be temporary or permanent. This uncertainty causes many people to worry that the cancer will come back. While many remissions are permanent, it is important to talk with your doctor about the possibility of the cancer returning. Understanding your risk of recurrence and the treatment options may help you feel more prepared if the cancer does return. Learn more about coping with the fear of recurrence. If the cancer returns after the original treatment, it is called recurrent cancer. It may come back in the same place, meaning it is a local recurrence, or nearby, which is a regional recurrence. If it comes back in another place, it is a distant recurrence. If a recurrence happens, a new cycle of testing will begin again to learn as much as possible about it. After this testing is done, you and your doctor will talk about the treatment options. Often the treatment plan will include the treatments described above, such as surgery and radiation therapy, but they may be used in a different combination or given at a different pace. Your doctor may suggest clinical trials that are studying new ways to treat recurrent AdCC. Whichever treatment plan you choose, palliative care will be important for relieving symptoms and side effects. People with recurrent cancer sometimes experience emotions such as disbelief or fear. You are encouraged to talk with your health care team about these feelings and ask about support services to help you cope. Learn more about dealing with cancer recurrence. Return to top ',\n",
       "  'Recovery from cancer is not always possible. If the cancer cannot be cured or controlled, the disease may be called advanced or terminal. This diagnosis is stressful, and for some people, advanced cancer is difficult to discuss. However, it is important to have open and honest conversations with your health care team to express your feelings, preferences, and concerns. The health care team has special skills, experience, and knowledge to support patients and their families and is there to help. Making sure a person is physically comfortable, free from pain, and emotionally supported is extremely important. People who have advanced cancer and who are expected to live less than 6 months may want to consider hospice care. Hospice care is designed to provide the best possible quality of life for people who are near the end of life. You and your family are encouraged to talk with the health care team about hospice care options, which include hospice care at home, a special hospice center, or other health care locations.

       "  ' Doctors and scientists are always looking for better ways to care for people with adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC). To make scientific advances, doctors create research studies involving volunteers, called clinical trials. Every drug that is now approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was tested in clinical trials. Clinical trials are used for all types and stages of AdCC. Many focus on new treatments to learn if a new treatment is safe, effective, and possibly better than the existing treatments. These types of studies evaluate new drugs, different combinations of treatments, new approaches to radiation therapy or surgery, and new methods of treatment. People who participate in clinical trials can be some of the first to get a treatment before it is available to the public. However, there are some risks with a clinical trial, including possible side effects and the chance that the new treatment may not work. People are encouraged to talk with their health care team about the pros and cons of joining a specific study. Some clinical trials study new ways to relieve symptoms and side effects during treatment. Others study ways to manage the late effects that may happen a long time after treatment. Talk with your doctor about clinical trials for symptoms and side effects. ',\n",
       "  'People decide to participate in clinical trials for many reasons. For some, a clinical trial is the best treatment option available. Because standard treatments are not perfect, patients are often willing to face the added uncertainty of a clinical trial in the hope of a better result. Others volunteer for clinical trials because they know that these studies are a way to contribute to the progress in treating AdCC. Even if they do not benefit directly from the clinical trial, their participation may benefit future people with AdCC. Insurance coverage and the costs of clinical trials differ by location and by study. In some programs, some of the expenses from participating in the clinical trial are reimbursed. In others, they are not. It is important to talk with the research team and your insurance company first to learn if and how your treatment in a clinical trial will be covered.\\xa0Learn more about health insurance coverage of clinical trials. Sometimes people have concerns that, in a clinical trial, they may receive no treatment by being given a placebo or a ‚Äúsugar pill.‚Äù When used, placebos are usually combined with standard treatment in most cancer clinical trials. Study participants will always be told when a placebo is used in a study. Find out\\xa0more about placebos in cancer clinical trials. ',\n",
       "  'To join a clinical trial, people must participate in a process known as informed consent. During informed consent, the doctor should: Describe all of the treatment options so that the person understands how the new treatment differs from the standard treatment.\\n\\n\\nList all of the risks of the new treatment, which may or may not be different than the risks of standard treatment.\\n\\n\\nExplain what will be required of each person in order to participate in the clinical trial, including the number of doctor visits, tests, and the schedule of treatment.\\n\\n\\nDescribe the purposes of the clinical trial and what researchers are trying to learn. Clinical trials also have certain rules called ‚Äúeligibility criteria‚Äù that help structure the research and keep patients safe. You and the research team will carefully review these criteria together. You will need to meet all of the eligibility criteria in order to participate in a clinical trial. Learn more about eligibility criteria in clinical trials. People who participate in a clinical trial may stop participating at any time for personal or medical reasons. This may include that the new treatment is not working or there are serious side effects. Clinical trials are also closely monitored by experts who watch for any problems with each study. It is important that people participating in a clinical trial talk with their doctor and researchers about who will be providing their treatment and care during the clinical trial, after the clinical trial ends, and/or if they choose to leave the clinical trial before it ends.

During follow-up care, a doctor familiar with your medical history can give you personalized information about your risk of recurrence. Your doctor will ask specific questions about your health. Some people may have blood tests or imaging tests done as part of regular follow-up care, but testing recommendations depend on several factors, including the type and stage of cancer first diagnosed and the types of treatment given.
